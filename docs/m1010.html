<h3>Course Syllabus: <a href="http://math.fdltcc.edu/wetherbee/m1010/">
http://math.fdltcc.edu/wetherbee/m1010/</a></h3>
<p>Class materials will be online on D2L under <b>Content</b>.  
For easier recollection, you can find this course 
from this URL: <b>math.fdltcc.edu</b></p>


<h3>Zoom Class Meetings, Email, Videos</h3>
<p>We are starting the semester with zoom classes and may continue using zoom through the semester.
Install a zoom client on your computer with a microphone, speaker, and camera.  There are zoom apps 
for iphone and android phones.  Test zoom out between devices.  

<p>For zoom class sessions, login to D2L 
and note the zoom ID and password for zoom class meetings.  These probably will not change
for the course; I would let you know by email if there are changes.

<p>Check your email daily!  This is how I'll communicate with the entire class.

<p>Some videos will be put online.  You can check this one out to see how they play
on your devices:  

<p> <a href="http://math.fdltcc.edu/wetherbee/video/compress.mp4">Video:compression</a>

<p>Make sure that you can view this.  If you want to see closed captions (CC), they are in this
video.  Make sure that your video player can show CC if you want them.

<h3>D2L: <a href="https://fdltcc.learn.minnstate.edu/">https://fdltcc.learn.minnstate.edu/</a></h3>
<p>Get to know your star ID and password for D2L and email, and check you email daily.  Information
will be online from D2L or on this website when you login to the course.

<p>From the textbook website you can view the textbook online using their viewer, 
you can download the entire book in PDF format, or you can download for Kindle.  You
can also download the entire textbook in PDF format from this local server directory:

<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>You may have a calculator already, but make sure that it is a scientific calculator. 
If you need to buy one, I recommend a cheap calculator like a TI-30XS Multiview.  This does what you need, and the bookstore
sells them for under $20 .  If you have a problem getting one, let me know.  You need
to have it available for all assignments.  You do not need a more expensive graphing calculator,
but, if you have one, it will be fine.

<h3>SageMath: <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">SageMathCell</a></h3>
<p>This is software like Mathematica and Maple which can do symbolic algebra, 
graphing, and many other mathematical things, but SageMath is free.  A jupyter
notebook with SageMath should be available later in this course; in the meanwhile,
SageMathCell from the link above works well.

<h3>Exams and Grading</h3>
<pre>
3 tests     3x100 = 300
1 final             150
25 homework 4x25 =  100

<h3>The Course</h3>
<p>This course addresses FDLTCC liberal education requirements 
(Competencies Across the Curriculum) in problem solving and technology.  
You should come to class everyday! This is the easy way to do well in 
any course, and it is especially true for math classes.  There are 
exercises in the text for you to do, and these are usually answered 
at the end of each chapter. You will also get homework assignments 
on handouts, and you should complete then hand these in at the 
beginning of the next class. You homework grade is based on 
completing and turning in these homework handouts.  You will also 
get sample exams which will be similar in length and content to 
the in-class exams.  Let me know if there is are accommodations 
you need for the class.
