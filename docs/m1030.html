<p>Class materials will be online on D2L under <b>Content</b>.  
For easier recollection, you can find this course 
from this URL: <b>math.fdltcc.edu</b></p>


<h3>Zoom Class Meetings, Email, Videos</h3>
<p>We are starting the semester with zoom classes and may continue using zoom through the semester.
Install a zoom client on your computer with a microphone, speaker, and camera.  There are zoom apps 
for iphone and android phones.  Test zoom out between devices.  

<p>For zoom class sessions, login to D2L 
and note the zoom ID and password for zoom class meetings.  These probably will not change
for the course; I would let you know by email if there are changes.

<p>Check your email daily!  This is how I'll communicate with the entire class.

<p>Some videos will be put online.  Class recordings are one D2L under Content.

<h3>D2L: <a href="https://fdltcc.learn.minnstate.edu/">https://fdltcc.learn.minnstate.edu/</a></h3>
<p>Get to know your star ID and password for D2L and email, and check you email daily.  Information
will be online from D2L or on this website when you login to the course.

Introductory Statistics
<a href="https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/beginning-statistics/">Online:Creative Commons</a>
</pre>

<p>You should not print out the textbook.  It will not disappear.  You can download
the PDF for viewing on your own machine if this is handy for you.  You will probably read some sections
more carefully than others.  Sections are referenced in the tentative scheule as needed.

<p>Statistics textbooks vary in details; you will note differences if you look through
other texts and references.  We will use the conventions in this textbook.  One weakness
of this textbook is that the tables are difficult to use and, notably, difficult to print
out in readable form.  Here are some common tables in better form:

<pre>
<a href="https://tedwetherbee.github.io/spring2021/std_normal_table.pdf">Standard Normal</a>
<a href="https://tedwetherbee.github.io/spring2021/binomial_table.pdf">Binomial</a>
<a href="https://tedwetherbee.github.io/spring2021/t_table.pdf">t table</a>
<a href="https://tedwetherbee.github.io/spring2021/t_table2.pdf">t table 2</a>
</pre>

<h3>Calculators, Computers, PEDs (Personal Electronic Devices)</h3>
<p>You may have a calculator already, but make sure that it is a scientific calculator which has
the needed statistical functions.  We will cover this in class.

<p>I recommend, however, the calculator TI-30XS Multiview.  This does what you need.  Fancier 
calculators may be more difficult to use.  The bookstore
sells the TI-30XS Multiview for under $20 .  Bring your calculator to class.  
You must have it for exams and quizzes, so bring it to class everyday and get familiar with it.

<p>Do not play games, email, text, chat, surf, talk, etc. etc. on your PEDs. Turn 
these things off during class and put them away.  PEDs and computers are 
not allowed for exams or quizzes.

<p>Here are some online calculators, however, you may use for your homework.

<h3>Exams and Grading</h3>
<pre>
4 tests     4x100 = 400
1 final             200
10 homework 10x10 = 100
-----------------------
                    700 total

90-100%   A
80-90%    B
70-80%    C
60-70%    D
0-60%     F
</pre>

<h3>The Course</h3>
<p>This course addresses FDLTCC liberal education requirements 
(Competencies Across the Curriculum) in problem solving and technology.  
You should come to class everyday! This is the easy way to do well in 
any course, and it is especially true for math classes.  There are 
exercises in the text for you to do, and these are usually answered 
at the end of each chapter. You will also get homework assignments 
on handouts, and you should complete then hand these in at the 
beginning of the next class. You homework grade is based on 
completing and turning in these homework handouts.  You will also 
get sample exams which will be similar in length and content to 
the in-class exams.  Let me know if there is are accommodations 
you need for the class.</p>
