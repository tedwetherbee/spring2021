<h3>Course Syllabus: <a href="http://math.fdltcc.edu/wetherbee/m2001/">
http://math.fdltcc.edu/wetherbee/m2001/</a></h3>
<p>Class materials will be online on D2L under <b>Content</b>.  
For easier recollection, you can find this course 
from this URL: <b>math.fdltcc.edu</b></p>


<h3>Zoom Class Meetings, Email, Videos</h3>
<p>We are starting the semester with zoom classes and may continue using zoom through the semester.
Install a zoom client on your computer with a microphone, speaker, and camera.  There are zoom apps 
for iphone and android phones.  Test zoom out between devices.  

<p>For zoom class sessions, login to D2L 
and note the zoom ID and password for zoom class meetings.  These probably will not change
for the course; I would let you know by email if there are changes.

<p>Check your email daily!  This is how I'll communicate with the entire class.

<p>Some videos will be put online.  You can check this one out to see how they play
on your devices:  

<p> <a href="http://math.fdltcc.edu/wetherbee/video/compress.mp4">Video:compression</a>

<p>Make sure that you can view this.  If you want to see closed captions (CC), they are in this
video.  Make sure that your video player can show CC if you want them.

<h3>D2L: <a href="https://fdltcc.learn.minnstate.edu/">https://fdltcc.learn.minnstate.edu/</a></h3>
<p>Get to know your star ID and password for D2L and email, and check you email daily.  Information
will be online from D2L or on this website when you login to the course.

<h3>Text</h3>
<pre>
<b>Calculus</b>, by Thomas &amp; Finney; pub Addison Wesley
9th: ISBN: 0201531747 , or
Alternate: ISBN 0-321-19363-6
(These two editions are page-for-page identical.)

This textbook is in the FDLTCC bookstore at a modest price.  You can also
usually find used copies online at very reasonable prices.
</pre>

<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>You may have a calculator already, but make sure that it is a scientific calculator. 
If you need to buy one, I recommend a cheap calculator like a TI-30XS Multiview.  This does what you need, and the bookstore
sells them for under $20 .  If you have a problem getting one, let me know.  You need
to have it available for all assignments.  You do not need a more expensive graphing calculator,
but, if you have one, it will be fine.

<h3>SageMath: <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">SageMathCell</a></h3>
<p>This is software like Mathematica and Maple which can do symbolic algebra, 
graphing, and many other mathematical things, but SageMath is free.  A jupyter
notebook with SageMath should be available later in this course; in the meanwhile,
SageMathCell from the link above works well.

<h3>Exams and Grading</h3>
<pre>
4 tests     4x100 = 400
1 final             200
50 homework 2x50 =  100
-----------------------
                    700 total

90-100%   A
80-90%    B
70-80%    C
60-70%    D
0-60%     F
</pre>

<h3>The Course</h3>
<p>This course addresses FDLTCC liberal education requirements (Competencies Across 
the Curriculum)
in problem solving and technology.  You should come to class everyday! This is the 
easy way to do well in any course, and it is especially true for math classes.  
There are exercises in the text for you to do, and these are usually answered at 
the end of each chapter. You will also get homework assignments on handouts, and 
you should complete then hand these in at the beginning of the next class. You 
homework grade is based on completing and turning in these homework handouts.  
You will also get sample exams which will be similar in length and content to 
the in-class exams.  Let me know if there is are accommodations you need for 
the class.</p>
